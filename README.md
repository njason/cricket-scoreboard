(3:46:01 PM) Jason Biegel: go to calibrate
(3:46:07 PM) adrian fraiha: k
(3:46:22 PM) Jason Biegel: the number on the top left is the one you should try to hit
(3:46:49 PM) Jason Biegel: throw three darts at that number then press the number below that corresponds to the amount of hits you got
(3:47:06 PM) adrian fraiha: oo..
(3:47:07 PM) Jason Biegel: so if you got 2 double 20s and then a single 20, you would hit 5
(3:47:08 PM) adrian fraiha: cool
(3:47:23 PM) Jason Biegel: it cycles from 20 to bull
(3:47:39 PM) Jason Biegel: i would recommend going through at least 4 - 5 times
(3:47:43 PM) Jason Biegel: for each number
(3:47:50 PM) adrian fraiha: okay sweet
(3:48:06 PM) Jason Biegel: one thing to note is you have to hit it atleast once
(3:48:21 PM) Jason Biegel: or else your average and standard deviation will be 0
(3:48:35 PM) Jason Biegel: nam' sayin?
(3:48:39 PM) adrian fraiha: yeah
(3:48:46 PM) adrian fraiha: we should also find a league

(3:49:11 PM) adrian fraiha: oo
(3:49:31 PM) Jason Biegel: you can re-calibrate by going to the page and doing it again
(3:49:44 PM) Jason Biegel: it starts from scratch each time
(3:49:50 PM) Jason Biegel: not based off your old calibration
(3:49:58 PM) Jason Biegel: all stats are stored in localStorage
(3:50:23 PM) Jason Biegel: localStorage work on android chrome, havnt tested on iphones though
(3:50:54 PM) Jason Biegel: if there are no stored statistics, it does have fallback ones
(3:51:15 PM) Jason Biegel: oh yeah also you can press undo if you hit the wrong number
(3:52:06 PM) Jason Biegel: the game itself also has an undo button
(4:03:49 PM) Jason Biegel: oh yeah for 1 player, when you want the computer to go you just hit any of the blue recatangles once
